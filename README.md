RPMEd is a novel dataset consisting of 1000 RPM problems designed to evaluate machine learning models’ ability to solve visual reasoning
tasks. This dataset(RPMed, RPM for education) includes variations of geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, arrows, hexagons,
pentagons, and others, with applied transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping the shape’s fill. Each matrix in the dataset
has a corresponding correct answer stored in a text file for supervised learning tasks.
